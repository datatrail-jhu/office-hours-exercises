# Guide for Tutors/Curriculum wranglers

Your responsibilities as a DataTrail tutor:

- Attending and leading office hours - have an exercise ready but also leave lots of time for questions. There are [office hours exercises you can use here](https://github.com/datatrail-jhu/office-hours-exercises) or make up your own depending on the needs of the cohort.
- Responding to student questions inside or outside of office hours.
- Tracking or making fixes to curriculum as needed
- Helping Ashley track the student's progress in the course using the Scholar Tracking Sheet.
  - Mainly you will need to evaluate the turned in projects
    - Is there a clear effort made by the student to follow the listed objectives? Whether or not the code successfully runs that point in time?
  - Between you and Ashley you can track the quizzes and office hours participation

## Where to go for different scenarios

|Scenario| Where to go|
|--------|------------|
|A student has a question about payments, attendance policy, or other admin parts of the program | Send them to Ashley|
|A student has a very specific question that they've DM'ed you| Answer it in DM's or schedule a zoom call or in person call with them to cover it.|
|A student has a question that's applicable to the whole class| Answer it in DM's but then probably write a BaseCamp message about it for others to see. Maybe also cover it in office hours|
|A student has encountered a quiz question that is unclear| [You can see the answers here](https://github.com/datatrail-jhu/DataTrail_Quizzes/tree/main/quizzes) `C)` or capitalized answers are the correct ones|
|A student has encountered a swirl question that is unclear| [You can see the answers here](https://github.com/datatrail-jhu/datatrail-swirl/tree/main/DataTrail_Complete) |
|A swirl module question isn't clear or generally unfair| [See here about how to give a student credit manually](https://github.com/datatrail-jhu/datatrail-swirl#to-give-a-student-credit-manually) |
|A student is having troubles with a DataTrail project that is unclear| [See possible 'solutions' here](https://github.com/datatrail-jhu/DataTrail_Projects_Solutions) |
|There's a problem with the curriculum (quiz or something else) that isn't immediate| [File a GitHub issue here](https://github.com/datatrail-jhu/DataTrail) |
| There's a problem with the curriculum (but not a quiz) that IS immediate| [File a PR here](https://github.com/datatrail-jhu/DataTrail) but then post a BaseCamp message alerting other students to the problem and what they should do |
| There's a problem with the a quiz that IS immediate| [See instructions here about how quizzes are set up](https://www.ottrproject.org/examples.html#Setting_up_quizzes) but then post a BaseCamp message alerting other students to the problem and what they should do |
| There's a problem with a swirl module that IS immediate| Follow instructions on [this README about how to update a swirl module](https://github.com/datatrail-jhu/datatrail-swirl) After you've fixed and repacked the problematic swirl course, you will need to [upload the fixed .swc and file a PR to here](https://github.com/datatrail-jhu/scn) in order for students to be able to access the fixed module. They will need to reinstall the problematic swirl module|
|A course image needs to be updated| Try to find the [google slide here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1llAQt0f5Pu_wF1e5hc40cdpqUnOHpDo3) Note at this point in time the slides are not reorganized in the structure of the reorganized curriculum :( Once the image is updated, if you [re-render the DataTrail curriculum using the GitHub action here](https://github.com/datatrail-jhu/DataTrail/actions/workflows/render-all.yml)|
|A student is working on a project and needs to find a dataset to use| Show them the suggested datasets to play with here: [datatrail-jhu/open-datasets](https://github.com/datatrail-jhu/open-datasets)

## Student Instructions you should be familiar with:

Pasted below is the instructions the students are given in Basecamp about how to receive credit for the course:

### General Leanpub Navigation
1. Go to Leanpub to get the DataTrail course (scroll the price to the left to make it $0 -- don't pay anything for the course!). Complete the steps to "purchase" the course.

2. In the menu, go to Library > Courses and you should see DataTrail there. Click on that and click 'Start the course'.

3. The course is split into 7 overall sections:
- 00 Intro - (note this section doesn't have a project!)
- 01 Forming Questions
- 02 Getting Data
- 03 Cleaning the Data
- 04 Plot the Data
- 05 Get the Stats
- 06 Share Results
- 07 Build your Resume - This project isn't an Rmd but a website

### Receiving credit for each section:
To get credit and payment for your work on each section, you will need to:

1. Attend all office hours with your camera on.
2. You will be assigned an assignment folder where you will need to submit two things for each section:
- Complete and pass quizzes for the sections and submit your progress report to your assignment folder.
- Complete the projects and submit them to your assignment folder.

### Navigating the Course on Leanpub

When you go through the chapters, click on the screen and it will pop up the content for you. Following most chapters there will be a quiz. Be sure to complete the quizzes as you will need to submit your progress on quizzes as well.
Add the end of each section there is a project that you will complete

### Instructions for students to submit quiz progress

1. To get your course progress, go to 'Course Home'
2. Click on 'View Results'.  It should bring you to a page like this:
3. In your browser menu, click 'Print' and "Save as PDF"
4. Submit this PDF to your designated assignment folder.

### Instructions for students to submit projects
1. At the end of each section, there is a project you will be prompted to do:
2. Follow the instructions here and in the notebook you are sent to.
3. Your goal will be to complete all the instructions described under the "Your objectives" section.
4. You will want to Run the whole project and save it before submitting. If you encounter errors that you are not able to solve, that is okay -- and part of the data science project!
5. Do your best to ask questions about the errors you see ahead of time so the tutors can help you get unstuck, but if the deadline is approaching and you are still unable to run your notebook, write a summary in the Rmd file about what you were attempting to do and keep the code that wasn't working.
6. Here's how you export your project files once you have your project where you are ready to submit.
- Re-run it
- Save it
- Check off the Rmd and nb.html file
- More > Export
- Save that zip file with the project name + your name + .zip
7. Submit this zip file to your designated assignment folder to receive credit.
